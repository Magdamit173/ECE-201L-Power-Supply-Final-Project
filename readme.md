## EDC Power Supply Final Project  
⦁ Self-Explanatory Repository ~ Cheers!

## Schematic (Not Documented Yet)  
⦁ LM317 / LM337 Regulator Setup  
⦁ Input: 33.9V  
⦁ Output: 1.25V–30V  
⦁ Caps spaced for ripple + thermal safety  
⦁ Heatsink logic applied (adhesive mount, no screws)

## 3D View (Not Documented Yet)
⦁ TO-220 regulators with vertical heatsinks  
⦁ Terminal blocks for modular access  
⦁ Potentiometer for output tuning  
⦁ Stars-922 adhesive used for heatsink bonding  
⦁ Layout optimized for airflow + debug access
